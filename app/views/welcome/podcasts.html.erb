<h2>Iman Ghaffari Reflection</h2>

<p>All this discussion certainly has me thinking. Talking with people from all walks of engineering life has exposed me to many different strategies for resilience. </p>

<p>It became apparent to me that engineering life is fraught with challenges, and being able to recover from these <i>(being resilient)</i> was vital for being able to progress on a job. 
</p>

<p>All this discussion certainly has me thinking. Talking with people from all walks of engineering life has exposed me to many different strategies for resilience. </p>

<p>Through discussions with such resilient people, I was able to see that their resilience did not only help them to recover from a setback but also to become stronger, a concept echoed by -Epstein and Krasner (2013). 
 </p>

<p>It was certainly interesting also to explore how resilience was useful and necessary in response to large challenges and smaller, day-to-day challenges. In both scenarios, the same skills which helped individuals recover. From this perspective, it becomes even more important for me to develop resilience skills, so I decided to do a little more digging </p>

<p>After we finished filming the podcast episode, Hannah directed me towards the Australian government’s HealthDirect website (HealthDirect 2019), which lists the following strategies for resilience:
<li>Building healthy relationships and knowing when to ask for help</li>
<li>Managing stress and anxiety levels</li>
<li>Problem-solving skills</li>
<li>Developing Self-esteem and remembering one’s strengths</li>
</p><br>

<h3>Healthy Relationships</h3>
<p>It is noted that some individual or organisations’ resilience ability is not held internally, but held externally in social networks (Stevenson & Conradson 2017). These networks provide financial, logistical and emotional support. In further research after the podcast, I was surprised to learn that family and social support in an ICU could even help us to recover quicker from trips to the hospital (Wong & Liamputtong 2018). This is certainly what we saw in Voldemort’s experience with his friend and carer Peter Pettigrew! </p><br>

<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
<p>This strategy echoed Elon’s tips for resilience from the podcast, so I had a look into his resource; the Stanford School of Design Thinking. I found that indeed Design Thinking has been reported as a useful tool for approaching and building resilience (Ruth & Goessling-Reisemann 2019). The School talk about resilience as one of the tools needed to become a successful professional in the tech world (Johnson et al. 2020). I took away some resources from the Stanford website which should come in handy the next time I am stuck on a problem and need to reframe my perspective - I think this will help me to recover as those who take a proactive approach to problem-solving are more resilient than those who are reactive (Joseph 2001).

</p><br>

<h3>Managing Stress and Anxiety Levels</h3>
<p>Listening back to the podcast, I was questioning my resilience levels but considering now I can see how I am constantly battling stress and anxiety with conflicting schedules and due dates! </p>

<p>I came across SMART training, Stress Management and Resilience training (Soot et al. 2011), which I have admittedly come across in university brochures and emails before. To summarise, </p>


<p>1. Take a difficult situation: <i>let’s say an AWOL group member</i></p>
<p>2. Consider if the reaction I am having is accurate: <i>Anger and frustration, perhaps passive aggressiveness</i></p>
<li style="margin-left:7.5em" type="square">Going with this initial response: <i>Outcome is likely giving said group member a bad peer review and stressing myself out trying to overload on work</i></li>
<p>3. Reconsider: <i>maybe they are really struggling with the online transition for university work</i></p>
<li style="margin-left:7.5em" type="square">Going with reconsidered response: <i>I can reach out to them, get advice from a tutor and minimise my stress. This would allow me to work better with the group member, increase communication and decrease negativity amongst the team and myself. </i></li>


<p>
This almost reflects Marcus’ lesson on handling situations, wherein our experience of a situation is directly influenced by our reaction or opinion of that situation. Resilient people are those who are able to view life’s challenges in positive and constructive ways.

</p><br>


<h3>Self Esteem & Strengths</h3>
<p>From listening to Mulan speak about her time in the war and bringing those learnt skills through to her engineering role, I was struck by how important a role self-esteem played in resilience. Further research into the topic (see Hames & Joiner 2012) made me aware that affirmative self talk and self belief can increase my levels of resilience and directly affect how positively I recover from or overcome difficult events. Much like Mulan.</p>
